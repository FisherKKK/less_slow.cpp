Much of modern code suffers from common pitfalls: bugs, security issues, and performance bottlenecks.
Most things taught in universities are outdated, and most things taught in bootcamps are oversimplified.
This repository provides practical examples of how to write efficient software in C and C++.

![Less Slow C++](https://github.com/ashvardanian/ashvardanian/blob/master/repositories/LessSlow.cpp.jpg?raw=true)

Even if a certain example looks over-engineered, it doesn't make it less relevant and impractical.
All described pattern appears implicitly in any major program without most programmers acknowledging them.
That's one of the reasons an average developer loves the idea of abstractions like multiple inheritance with dynamic polymorphism (like virtual functions in C++) or using dynamic memory allocations in loops.
They rarely design benchmarks that contain 100K+ lines of code, like most programs. 
They rarely scale to hundreds of cores, like most modern cloud instances.
They rarely deal with specialized hardware accelerators with separate address spaces.
But we don't want to be average, we want to be better, right?

## Quick Start

> [Jump to reading](#basics) ðŸ”—

If you are familiar with C++ and want to go through code and measurements as you read, you can clone the repository and execute the following commands.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ashvardanian/LessSlow.cpp.git  # Clone the repository
cd LessSlow.cpp                                             # Change the directory
cmake -B build_release                                      # Generate the build files
cmake --build build_release --config Release                # Build the project
build_release/less_slow                                     # Run the benchmarks
```

For brevity, the tutorial is intended for GCC and Clang compilers on Linux, but should be compatible with MacOS and Windows.
To control the output or run specific benchmarks, use the following flags:

```sh
build_release/less_slow --benchmark_format=json             # Output in JSON format
build_release/less_slow --benchmark_out=results.json        # Save the results to a file, instead of `stdout`
build_release/less_slow --benchmark_filter=std_sort         # Run only benchmarks containing `std_sort` in their name
```

> The builds will [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) and [Intel's oneTBB](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB) for the Parallel STL implementation.

To enhance stability and reproducibility, use the `--benchmark_enable_random_interleaving=true` flag which shuffles and interleaves benchmarks as described [here](https://github.com/google/benchmark/blob/main/docs/random_interleaving.md).

```sh
build_release/less_slow --benchmark_enable_random_interleaving=true
```

Google Benchmark supports [User-Requested Performance Counters](https://github.com/google/benchmark/blob/main/docs/perf_counters.md) through `libpmf`.
Note that collecting these may require `sudo` privileges.

```sh
sudo build_release/less_slow --benchmark_enable_random_interleaving=true --benchmark_format=json --benchmark_perf_counters="CYCLES,INSTRUCTIONS"
```

Alternatively, use the Linux `perf` tool for performance counter collection:

```sh
sudo perf stat taskset 0xEFFFEFFFEFFFEFFFEFFFEFFFEFFFEFFF build_release/less_slow --benchmark_enable_random_interleaving=true --benchmark_filter=super_sort
```

## Abstractions

### Virtual Functions and Polymorphism

### Ranges and Iterators

### Coroutines and Asynchronous Programming

C++20 introduces coroutines, or pre-emptive multitasking, which allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner.
Unlike a function, a coroutine can be paused and resumed at `co_await` and `co_yield` points.
In high-level languages the implementation of coroutines is universally bad and prohibitively expensive.
In C++, they are much better, but still have a cost.
